# BioInspiredComputing
Bioinspired computing assignment based on theoretical analysis among 10 bio-inspired computing algorithms and using PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) to develop Self-Assembly PSO (SAPSO). We perform comparative studies with CSA (Classical Self-Assembly) Algorithm


Several Swarm Algorithm considered in this study were:
1. Particle Swarm Optimization
2. Grey Wolf Optimization
3. Ant Colony Optimization
