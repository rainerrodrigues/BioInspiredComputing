# BioInspiredComputing Assignment
## Introduction
Bioinspired computing assignment based on theoretical analysis among 10 bio-inspired computing algorithms and using PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) to develop Self-Assembly PSO (SAPSO). We perform comparative studies with CSA (Classical Self-Assembly) Algorithm


Several Swarm Algorithm considered in this study were:
1. Particle Swarm Optimization
2. Grey Wolf Optimization
3. Ant Colony Optimization
4. Artificial Bee Colony Optimization
5. Bat Algorithm
6. Cuckoo Search Algorithm
7. Differential Evolution
8. FireFly Algorithm
9. Genetic Algorithm
10. Bee Colony Optimization

For the purpose of this study, we concluded that Particle Swarm Optimization would be the best fit to study and enhance the Classical Self-Assembly Algorithm for better performance and convergence.
